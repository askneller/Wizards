Spell Casting

first pass

[client]
- client side is managed by the ClientSpellCastingSystem
- a player has a list of Spells and ManaSources
- when a player joins for the first time the server will tell them what mana sources and spells they have
- when the player casts a spell (presses the key, whatever) the system sends an AttemptCastEvent with the spell to cast

[server]
- the event is sent to the server side CastingSystem which first queries the ManaSystem to see if the player has enough to cast the spell (maybe some other validation first)
- if so the system decreases the amount of mana the player has (informing player by event) and implements the spells effects
- final authority on spells known and mana sources available is the server side
